## Install the dependencies

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.  
It will also create the Git hooks with Husky if you Git version is recent enough.

Run `npm run start` to start the local development server.

## Nx

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

üîé **Nx is a set of Extensible Dev Tools for Monorepos.**

### Adding capabilities to your workspace

Nx supports many plugins which add capabilities for developing different types of applications and different tools.

These capabilities include generating applications, libraries, etc as well as the devtools to test, and build projects as well.

Below are our core plugins:

- [Angular](https://angular.io)
  - `ng add @nrwl/angular`
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/react`
- Web (no framework frontends)
  - `ng add @nrwl/web`
- [Nest](https://nestjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/nest`
- [Express](https://expressjs.com)
  - `ng add @nrwl/express`
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
  - `ng add @nrwl/node`

There are also many [community plugins](https://nx.dev/nx-community) you could add.

### Generate an application

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:app my-app` to generate an application.

> You can use any of the plugins above to generate applications as well.

When using Nx, you can create multiple applications and libraries in the same workspace.

### Generate a library

Run `ng g @nrwl/angular:lib my-lib` to generate a library.

> You can also use any of the plugins above to generate libraries as well.

Libraries are shareable across libraries and applications. They can be imported from `@yokai/mylib`.

### Development server

Run `ng serve my-app` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng g component my-component --project=my-app` to generate a new component.

### Build

Run `ng build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test my-app` to execute the unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Run `nx affected:test` to execute the unit tests affected by a change.

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e my-app` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io).

Run `nx affected:e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests affected by a change.

### Understand your workspace

Run `nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.

#### Computation Memoization in the Cloud

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-cloud-card.png"></p>

Nx Cloud pairs with Nx in order to enable you to build and test code more rapidly, by up to 10 times. Even teams that are new to Nx can connect to Nx Cloud and start saving time instantly.

Teams using Nx gain the advantage of building full-stack applications with their preferred framework alongside Nx‚Äôs advanced code generation and project dependency graph, plus a unified experience for both frontend and backend developers.

## Git

### Alias

This project uses an alias to push automatically with the upstream option set.  
The configuration of the alias is a [local one](.gitconfig).

This alias is used by the `cz` script to automatically push on the remote with a dynamic branch name.

**Troubleshooting:**

If the command `push-upstream` does not exists, you can link it to your git:  
Run `git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig`.

**_Note:_**

The error should be something like:

`git: 'push-upstream' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.`

## Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted.  
This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  
The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **type** and the **subject** are mandatory.  
All the other stuff is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 144 characters!  
This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.  
In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **feat** : A new feature
- **fix** : A bug fix
- **style** : Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf** : A code change that improves performance
- **test** : Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build** : Changes that affect the build system, CI configuration or external dependencies
- **docs** : Changes that affect the documentation
- **chore** : Anything else

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change.  
For example `datepicker`, `dialog`, `app`, etc.

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".  
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines.  
The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

## Reminders

### Comments

In some cases (probably due to a lack of ingenuity so any help is wanted) during the development some features are linked.  
To help linking seem together we use comments to identify those cases.  
To identify them easily the following syntax is used:

`@see [sonia-link-XXX]{@link https://github.com/Sonia-corporation/yokai/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sonia-link-XXX}` where `XXX` is an id.

Here is the list of linked features:
